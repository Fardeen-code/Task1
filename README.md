###This project serves as an introductory example of server-side rendering and form handling using Node.js, Express, and EJS. The implementation involves the following components:

Form Creation: An HTML form is designed in index.ejs, enabling users to input their name and email address.
Server Setup: An Express server is configured in server.js to handle HTTP requests. It renders the index.ejs template for the form display and processes form submissions to generate the result.ejs template.
Server-Side Rendering: Utilizing EJS, the server dynamically generates HTML content based on user input, delivering a personalized response upon form submission.####
